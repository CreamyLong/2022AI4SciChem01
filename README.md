Challenge#1
Collect and standardize chemical reaction data, including structures, reagents and
conditions.
 Standardization of chemical reaction data is challenging because there are varies
of reactions in organic chemistry. For example, reagents (such as Pd/C) may have
different specifications. Solvents may or may not participate (as a reactant) in the
reaction.
 NLP may be required to extract data from reaction procedures
